            <p>Learn the basics of adding collisions to static mesh objects in Unreal Engine, including primitives,
                auto convex hulls and custom imported geometry.</p>

            <img class="main-img" src="./images/COL01_Thumbnail.png" alt="" />

            <h3 id="mesh-types">Mesh Types</h3>
            <p>To start editing the collisions of a static mesh component press &#39;ctrl+E&#39;. This will open the
                editing window, which for static mesh actors is mainly useful for editing collision and rendering
                options like materials and LOD. Changes here apply to all copies of the object.</p>
            <p>From this window we can edit how the collisions work on our object. There are two main options for
                meshes: complex, which uses the render mesh of the object, and simple, which uses custom geometry for
                the collisions. Complex is not recommended in most cases since it uses a lot more performance than
                simple, but it is a good option for prototypes.</p>
            <p>Objects can use both types of collision, and there are settings for which type is used for different
                interactions. Make sure collision complexity is set to the type you&#39;re using if your collisions
                aren&#39;t working.</p>

            <img class="resize-img" width="60%" src="./images/COL02_CollisionOptions.png" alt="" />

            <p>Simple collisions are made using three different options: primitive shapes (cubes, spheres and capsules),
                auto convex meshes, or imported simplified meshes. Primitive and Auto Convex colliders can be added from
                the &#39;Collision&#39; dropdown at the top of the window. You can edit the position, rotation and scale
                of each primitive individually (no matter which type) using tools in the viewing window, as well as
                duplicate and delete them. Tip: Any simple colliders that are added to the object will appear in a list
                in the &#39;primitives&#39; section.</p>

            <p>List of options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complex</li>
                <li>Simple
                    <ul>
                        <li>Primitive</li>
                        <li>Auto Convex</li>
                        <li>Imported</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h4 id="convex-vs-concave-colliders">Convex vs Concave Colliders</h4>
            <p>When checking for collisions in a game engine the difference in complexity between convex and concave
                colliders is huge. In this context Concave is the opposite of Convex, which in this context means a
                shape that has no indents or &#39;caves&#39;, or more technically, has no cross-sections that are
                smaller in the middle than they are near the edges.</p>

            <img class="resize-img" width="70%" src="./images/COL11_ConvexLineDiagram.png" alt="" />

            <p>The reason convex colliders are much better is because if you know that a point is in between two
                surfaces of the shape, you know that it is definitely within the bound of the shape (in that axis). This
                means you can check if a collision has occurred using simple greater or less than calculations. With a concave
                shape you cannot use this technique, as a point between two surfaces could either be colliding or be in an
                indent. Collision algorithms for concave shapes are incredibly clever and
                well optimized, but are still magnitudes more time consuming than ones for convex shapes, so making
                as many shapes convex as possible (even if that means using multiple colliders per object) can make huge
                differences to performance.</p>
            <p>Primitive shapes are special convex shapes that are even more efficient because collisions with them can
                be checked for using maths instead of comparing meshes - for example a sphere collider just needs to
                check if a point is less than the length of the radius away from the center. This means using multiple
                primitive shapes is often faster than a single non-primitive shape.</p>
            <p>Note: make sure you create primitives within the engine - an incorrectly imported sphere will be treated
                as
                a mesh and therefore not use the efficient collision methods.</p>

            <h4 id="auto-convex-collisions">Auto Convex Collisions</h4>
            <p>The auto convex collider generator is an option in Unreal to quickly make convex colliders around your
                object. It creates multiple smaller &#39;hulls&#39; to fill different parts of the object, which has the
                benefit of being able to create concave shapes while still using simple collisions for performance. </p>

            <img class="main-img" src="./images/COL06_AutoConvexSettings.png" alt="" />

            <p>After choosing the Auto Convex option a tab with three options and an &#39;apply&#39; button will appear:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hull Count</strong> - this is the number of simple colliders the generator can make. Some
                    shapes will need more or less hulls, for example a simple tree could have quite accurate collisions
                    with one hull for the trunk and one for the branches, but a bucket would need at least five hulls
                    (bottom and four sides) to even start matching the correct collisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Max Hull Verts</strong> - the maximum number of vertices the hulls can have. In the tree vs
                    bucket example, the tree would need a high number of vertices to be accurate since the leaves and
                    trunk are both rounded. The bucket on the other hand wouldn&#39;t benefit much from more vertices,
                    since the hulls couldn&#39;t match the inside curve of the bucket without becoming concave.</li>
                <li><strong>Hull Precision</strong> - this lets you decide if the calculation should be done quickly with lower accuracy,
                    or slowly with higher accuracy. For most of the objects I&#39;ve tested the maximum precision value
                    takes about a minute, so I tend to try low precision first, then put it much higher if it wasn&#39;t
                    right the first time. The precision value seems make the colliders match the size of the object
                    better, but didn&#39;t seem to improve some of the big problems I had trying to use the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The main problem I found is that even on high settings (precision, hulls and vertices) the generator
                often leaves gaps between hulls create holes into or even through the object. This is especially bad for
                large terrain pieces, as the player can fall into these holes and get stuck. The documentation implies
                that there are technical reasons for collision meshes not overlapping each other, but I couldn&#39;t
                find exactly what the consequences were to decide if they are worth avoiding.</p>

                initComparisons();
            </script>

            <p><strong>Unity Comparison:</strong>
                In Unity there is an option to use a convex version of the collider, which simply expands the mesh to
                cover any indents. This is great for objects that are already mostly convex like rocks and walls, but
                bad for objects that need to be concave to function, such as a bucket or a doorway.</p>
            <p>Having a flexible system for generating colliders in Unreal Engine is nice, but I think Unity&#39;s
                solution is a better one - the simplicity makes it easier to decide if a different solution is needed or
                not, and more collisions than expected (e.g. colliders that are slightly larger or have less corners
                than the real geometry) are much less noticeable than a lack of collisions, since clipping inside a mesh
                immediately breaks a players immersion.</p>
            <h4 id="importing-meshes">Importing Meshes</h4>
            <p>The most reliable way to set up colliders in Unreal is to import custom meshes for them. The system to do
                this is opaque, but good once you&#39;ve learnt it. To start you need a 3D model file, preferably in FBX
                format. If you want to use meshes from packages or FAB, you can either open the object and find the
                location of the FBX file under &#39;import settings &gt;&gt; file path&#39;, or you can create a copy of
                the FBX by finding the object in the content browser, right clicking and choosing &#39;asset actions
                &gt;&gt; export&#39;.</p>
            <p>Once you have the FBX open, you need to make a convex mesh for the object to use. Unreal Engine can
                import multiple meshes, and they can either be primitives (sphere, cube or capsule), or custom convex
                meshes. Your 3D modelling software should have options to simplify a mesh, and to make it convex. For
                example in Blender you can make a mesh convex by going into edit mode, then selecting the mesh by
                pressing &#39;A&#39; then selecting &#39;Mesh &gt;&gt; Convex Hull&#39;.</p>

            <img class="main-img" src="./images/COL07_ConvexOriginalCustom.png" alt="" />
            <p>In order to import custom colliders each collider object needs to have a specific name based on what type it is - and
                which object in the file it should be assigned to. The hierarchy or parenting of the objects is not important when
                importing, but primitives must not be warped or deformed. If the names of the objects are set up correctly you
                should be able to import the new FBX using the default settings. Unreal Engine will also detect changes to FBXs and
                pop up an option to automatically update them.</p>
            <p><strong>Naming rules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Box = <code>UBX_(RenderMeshName)_##</code></li>
                <li>Capsule = <code>UCP_(RenderMeshName)_##</code></li>
                <li>Sphere = <code>USP_(RenderMeshName)_##</code></li>
                <li>Convex = <code>UCX_(RenderMeshName)_##</code></li>
            </ul>

            <img class="main-img" src="./images/COL08_ImportedColliders.png" alt="" />

            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                If you want to put a custom Convex collider on an object called &#39;Car_Body&#39;, you need to call the
                collider mesh &#39;UCX_Car_Body_00&#39;. If you want to also assign a box collider to the body, you need
                to call the box mesh &#39;UBX_Car_Body_01&#39;.</p>
